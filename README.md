Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of multiple sheets that provide a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 situation. The visualizations include line charts, maps, bar charts, and other interactive elements that allow users to explore the data effectively.

Steps to Create the Dashboard
Load the Data into Tableau

Connect Tableau to the COVID-19 data source.
Ensure the data is clean and formatted correctly, with appropriate data types set for each column (e.g., date, numerical values).
Create Individual Worksheets for Visualizations

Map of Total Cases by Country/Region: A geographical representation of total COVID-19 cases.
Bar Chart for Daily New Deaths: Visualizes the daily new deaths due to COVID-19.
Line Chart for Recoveries and Deaths Over Time: Compares the trend of recoveries and deaths over time.
Testing Data Visualization: Shows the testing rate across different countries/regions.
Create Calculated Fields (If Needed)

Example: Active Cases = [Total Cases] - [Total Recoveries] - [Total Deaths]
Design the Dashboard Layout
